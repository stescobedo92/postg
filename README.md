# postg
This is an application developed in the Rust programming language that simplifies interaction with a PostgreSQL database by enabling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This project aims to provide a robust and efficient interface for managing data in a PostgreSQL database using Rust, harnessing the language's strengths in security and performance.

# How to Run
To run a Rust project, follow these steps:

* Install Rust: Make sure you have Rust and Cargo, the Rust package manager and build tool, installed on your system. You can download them from rust-lang.org.
* Run the Project: You can run your Rust project with `cargo run`. This will compile the code if needed and execute the program.

```rust
$ cargo run
```

There you have it! You now know how to run a Rust project. Continue developing and improving your code to create powerful and efficient Rust applications.
